	<h2>"Local elementary school up in flames Monday morning, investigation underway"</h2> 
		</p> 
<p>		CHARLESTON – Fire and police officials responded to a fire that killed two first grade students at a local elementary school Monday morning. 
Charleston Police Chief Garry Kerlikowske said that the fire was called in from a pay phone across the street of the burning school at 9:28 a.m. 
</p> 
<p>
The first fire department arrived six minutes later at 9:35 a.m. At least 50 firefighters from around the region were eventually at Forest Glen Elementary School. 
According to Charleston Fire Chief Gregory Deane, the two first grade students died in the fire due to “a severe asthmatic reaction triggered by the smoke.” Both students were in the same room. 
</p>
<p> 
Deane also said that at least 20 other children had smoke inhalation, but none of them were in serious condition. 
</p>
<p> 
Firefighters mostly contained the fire at the elementary school by 11 a.m., but the fire continued to burn into early afternoon. 
</p> 
<p>
The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Lt. Jon Charton of the Charleston Fire Department said, “Somebody thought the fire might have started in the kitchen.” Due to the layout of the school, some of the classrooms were at the end of the hall by the kitchen. 
Charton said that the back window of one of the classrooms was locked shut. The smoke was heaviest there, according to Charton. 
</p> 
<p>
“It’s really shocking. I don’t know who has been maintaining this school, but they should be in jail,” he said.
</p> 
<p> 
Fire Marshal Sam Zell said that the insulation of the building might have contributed to the acceleration of the fire. Zell said that definite answers would most likely not be available for days. 
</p>
<p> 
The one-story elementary school met standards when it was built 20 years ago, according to Ralph Schweitzer, the chief building inspector of the city’s building department. However, the school has not been inspected for more than two years due to cutbacks in city staff. 
Jasper Hendersen lived two blocks away from the school. He said he ran to the school to find his son, Billy, when he heard sirens and saw smoke. Hendersen said, “Scared the crap out of me. I got to the school and kids were screaming and crying, and the teachers were going crazy, and there was smoke and fire.” The father found his son hiding behind some trees at the edge of the schoolyard.
