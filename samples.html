		<h2>"The Evolution of Chinatown and the Cultural Effects of Gentrification" </h2> 
		<h4> 2014: College Writing (WRTG-100) With Allison Sparks (Research sample). Published in <i><a href="http://www.american.edu/cas/literature/cwp/upload/Atrium-CWP-2015.pdf" target="_blank">Atrium (pg. 157)</a></i></h4> 
A majority of the residents (mostly second and third generation) moved out into the suburbs, but the elders stayed behind in Chinatown as it was more convenient for them. However, as the prices continue to rise in Chinatown and the need to renovate by property owners intensifies, the elders may one day face a tough decision to leave their comfort zone. While a majority consciously made the decision to move out of Chinatown, one cannot ignore the fact that many moved out due to the rising property prices that occurred after the gentrification of the neighborhood. As the Chinese continue to move out of the area, the culture will go with them. Furthermore, while the Chinese living in and outside of Chinatown can still interact with one another, there is no longer a focal point or center. As a result, there is no definite sense of a strong community, aside from the invisible ties through friendships, kinships, and so forth. Community is required for culture to flourish and grow. In other words, culture revolves around community, among other things, and without this, it is difficult to say that developers succeeded in preserving Chinatown.

		<h2> "Mightier Than Swords holds their first open mic night of the year" </h2> 
		<h4> September 24, 2015. On-site information gathering and writing as an 						 
			assignment for class.</h4> 
Several American University students gathered outside the Davenport Coffee Lounge for the first open mic this year held by the university’s slam poetry club, Mightier Than Swords. 
The evening began with a late start as the coffee shop was closing up for the night and could not allow people to come in until the shop was cleaned up. The lively, excited group of students waited outside, chattered amongst themselves and signed up to perform during the wait.
