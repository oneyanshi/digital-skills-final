		of your lips rewrite history.”

My interest in journalism began when my dad accidentally subscribed
to a gaming magazine called <i>Game Informer.</i> I was captured by the vivid images and the articles that people wrote about the games that I played. I devoured all the reading that I could before our subscription ended. I aspired to write for the gaming magazine, but my interests broadened over the years, leaving the video game industry entirely to enter reporting hard news via print, radio and broadcast.

Currently, <b>I am a sophomore at American University</b>. I <b>major in broadcast journalism</b> and <b>minor in computer science</b>. It is an odd combination, but, in reality, it isn't <i>that</i> odd. Data journalism, for example, is a great fusion of the two fields. <b>I intend to dive into data journalism</b> at some point in my academic and professional career, but <b>I am also interested in the post-production process of broadcast, e.g. editing, cutting, archiving, etc.</b>

I am honored to have worked or currently work with incredible people throughout my career. I was a writer and assistant director/producer for a short film that had a total of twelve people on set. The short film "<b>The Dean's List</b>" premiered at Indy Film Fest 2015 in the category "Crime and Punishment." When I saw the film on the big screen from where I sat, I felt my heart swelled up and I knew that I was heading down the right path. Right now, I have the pleasure of being a Dean's Intern at <b>The Newseum as their video production/broadcast technology intern.</b>
